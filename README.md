`isotopologue_coordinates_conversion.f90` is a Fortran module for conversion between Euler coordinates of two rigid rotor molecules and Euler coordinates of their isotopomers.
Can be used to generate Potential Energy Surfaces for isotopomers in Euler coordinates.
See the comments in the source files for more detailed description.

`constants.f90` and `lapack.f90` are auxiliary modules.

`conversion_test.f90` is an example driver for the conversion module.

Compilation is straightforward, see `compile.sh` for an example.
